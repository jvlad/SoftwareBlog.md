## About Me
In 2014 I became software developer. It turned to be that my focus is on mobile application (both iOS and Android). After had been being employed by 2±2 companies and having experience of full-time in-office work in 2 countries, I switched to be a freelancer. The main reason is that I felt bad sitting in office most of the day.
